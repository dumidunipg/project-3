## Sea Temperature

*The rise in the sea temperature has largely been a result of an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which trap the sun's heat within the atmosphere. Recent calls for actions to reduce climate change stem partly from sea surface temperature data such as the ones in 2015 and 2018. Although the typical trend is where the temperature peaks around April and slowly decreases towards the end of the year, the two years within the last decade illustrate that the sea surface temperature continued to increase. The **Sustainable Development Goal 13 from the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 and the *^movement led by environmental activist Greta Thunberg in 2018 played a role in decreasing the sea surface temperatures in the following years. The annual average temperatures are on a downward trend since 2019, and although there is no data for December yet, the upward trend and a fairly significant increase in the average temperature for 2023 is another alarming sign for our environment.
