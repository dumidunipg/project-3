 The data file below contains 10 columns.  Columns 1-4 give the dates in several redundant 									
 formats. Column 5 below gives monthly Mauna Loa CO2 concentrations in micro-mol CO2 per   									
 mole (ppm), reported on the 2012 SIO manometric mole fraction scale.  This is the        									
 standard version of the data most often sought.  The monthly values have been adjusted    									
 to 24:00 hours on the 15th of each month.  Column 6 gives the same data after a seasonal  									
 adjustment to remove the quasi-regular seasonal cycle.  The adjustment involves           									
 subtracting from the data a 4-harmonic fit with a linear gain factor.  Column 7 is a      									
 smoothed version of the data generated from a stiff cubic spline function plus 4-harmonic 									
 functions with linear gain.  Column 8 is the same smoothed version with the seasonal      									
 cycle removed.  Column 9 is identical to Column 5 except that the missing values from     									
 Column 5 have been filled with values from Column 7.  Column 10 is identical to Column 6  									
 except missing values have been filled with values from Column 8.  Missing values are     									
 denoted by -99.99
